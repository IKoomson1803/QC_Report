<h3>Report Screens and Printing</h3>
<p>When the data you require has been entered and saved reports can be printed 
  depending on the user's choice. To print reports from any of the following input 
  screens click on the PRINTER ICON (example 1A. circled in red) in the upper 
  right. The screens include HEADER, HISTORY, TAPE LAYOUT, TEXT INFO, AUDIO &amp; 
  T.C., INDIVIDUAL SPECS, OVERALL SPECS, BVHE SPECS, CTISS SPECS, LOG and FINAL.</p>
<p><img src="images/reportsIcon.gif" width="700" height="52">1A.</p>
<p>The next screen to come up will be the Reports Screen like in example 1B.</p>
<p><img src="images/reports.gif" width="600" height="250">1B.</p>
<p>Reports that you can print or preview are Mastering QC Report, Technical Report 
  1, Technical Report 2, Technical Report 4, CTISS and Quality Control Report. 
  To preview a report check the checkbox next to that report and press the PREVIEW 
  button. If you would like to print a report check the checkbox next to that 
  report and click the PRINT button.</p>
<p>If you would like to make PDFs you will need to have the PDF WRITER installed 
  on your machine (please have your system administrator do this for you). Once 
  you have it installed you can proceed to create a PDF File.</p>
