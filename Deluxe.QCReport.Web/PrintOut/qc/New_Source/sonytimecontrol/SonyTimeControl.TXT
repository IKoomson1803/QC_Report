The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\Projects\sonytimecontrol\cab\SonyTimeControl.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\Projects\sonytimecontrol\cab\Support\SonyTimeControl.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
